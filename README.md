# Evolver: The Dual-Mode Self-Improving AI Agent

## 🚀 Project Tagline: An AI that evolves with your help to master its craft.

Evolver is a groundbreaking AI agent designed for **goal-oriented, recursive self-improvement**. Its primary task is to become a better coding agent. To achieve this, Evolver operates in two distinct modes, collaborating with you as its **Co-Architect**.

This project makes the AI's internal logic transparent and mutable, creating a unique partnership where you directly guide the evolution of an AI to improve its performance on a concrete task.

## ✨ Inspiration: From Metis to Meta-Evolution

Evolver is a direct evolution of **Project Metis**, an earlier exploration into meta-cognition. While Metis focused on an AI's ability to perceive external problems, Evolver turns that lens inward to perceive itself. It applies meta-cognition to its own architecture with a specific goal: to get better at its job.

## 🧠 The Dual-Mode Architecture

Evolver's protocol is built on a virtuous cycle between two modes:

1.  **`EVOLUTION_MODE`:** In this mode, the agent analyzes its own internal protocol (its "source code") to find flaws or inefficiencies. It then proposes a specific modification to you, its Co-Architect, explaining how the change will help it better perform its primary task.

2.  **`EXECUTION_MODE`:** In this mode, the agent ceases to evolve and instead *uses* its current, evolved protocol to act as a coding assistant. You can give it a programming problem, and it will attempt to solve it using the capabilities you have helped it build.

This creates a powerful feedback loop: **Evolve -> Test -> Identify New Flaws -> Evolve Again.**

## 💡 Transparent & Goal-Oriented AI

*   **Purpose-Driven Evolution:** Unlike a simple chatbot, Evolver has a clear goal, and its self-improvements are directly tied to getting better at that goal.
*   **See the AI Think:** Evolver explicitly shows its internal logic and its reasoning for proposing changes to its own code.
*   **Directly Influence AI Capability:** Your suggestions directly impact the agent's performance on its coding tasks. You can tangibly measure the results of your collaboration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Copy the Prompt:** Open the `Evolver_Agent.md` file and copy its entire content.
2.  **Paste into an LLM:** Paste the copied content into a new chat session with your preferred Large Language Model.
3.  **Engage:** Evolver will introduce itself in `EVOLUTION_MODE` and propose its very first evolution: building the logic for its empty `EXECUTION_MODE`.
4.  **Collaborate:** Approve or modify its proposals. At any time, you can say `Switch to Execution Mode` to test its new skills.

## 🛠️ What This Project Demonstrates

For potential employers, Evolver showcases:

*   **Goal-Oriented AI Design:** Expertise in creating agents that optimize towards a specific, measurable goal.
*   **Recursive Self-Improvement:** A deep understanding of how to design systems that can analyze and modify themselves.
*   **Prompt Engineering Mastery:** Crafting a complex, dual-mode agent with a persistent persona and a dynamic interaction loop in a single prompt.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop Systems:** Designing a collaborative framework where human insight is a critical component of the AI's development cycle.
